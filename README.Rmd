**Fo**recast **Reco**nciliation is a a post-forecasting process aimed to improve the accuracy and align forecasts for a system of linearly constrained (e.g. hierarchical/grouped) time series. The **FoReco** package provides a comprehensive set of classical (bottom-up, top-down and middle-out), and modern (optimal and heuristic combination) forecast reconciliation procedures in different frameworks including cross-sectional, temporal, or cross-temporal settings.

The core functions for reconciliation categorized by framework are as follows:

| **Reconciliation** | **Cross-sectional** | **Temporal** | **Cross-Temporal** |
|--------|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| *Classical&nbsp;reconciliation* |
| Top-down: `*td()` | [`cstd()`](https://danigiro.github.io/FoReco/reference/cstd.html) | [`tetd()`](https://danigiro.github.io/FoReco/reference/tetd.html) | [`cttd()`](https://danigiro.github.io/FoReco/reference/cttd.html) |
| Bottom-up: `*bu()` | [`csbu()`](https://danigiro.github.io/FoReco/reference/csbu.html) | [`tebu()`](https://danigiro.github.io/FoReco/reference/tebu.html) | [`ctbu()`](https://danigiro.github.io/FoReco/reference/ctbu.html) |
| Middle-out: `*mo()` | [`csmo()`](https://danigiro.github.io/FoReco/reference/csmo.html) | [`temo()`](https://danigiro.github.io/FoReco/reference/temo.html) | [`ctmo()`](https://danigiro.github.io/FoReco/reference/ctmo.html) |
| *Regression&#8209;based&nbsp;reconciliation* |
| Least squares: `*rec()` | [`csrec()`](https://danigiro.github.io/FoReco/reference/csrec.html) | [`terec()`](https://danigiro.github.io/FoReco/reference/terec.html) | [`ctrec()`](https://danigiro.github.io/FoReco/reference/ctrec.html) |
| LCC: `*lcc()` | [`cslcc()`](https://danigiro.github.io/FoReco/reference/cslcc.html) | [`telcc()`](https://danigiro.github.io/FoReco/reference/telcc.html) | [`ctlcc()`](https://danigiro.github.io/FoReco/reference/ctlcc.html) |
| *Probabilistic&nbsp;reconciliation* |
| MVN: `*mvn()` | [`csmvn()`](https://danigiro.github.io/FoReco/reference/csmvn.html) | [`temvn()`](https://danigiro.github.io/FoReco/reference/temvn.html) | [`ctmvn()`](https://danigiro.github.io/FoReco/reference/ctmvn.html) |
| Sample-based: `*smp()` | [`cssmp()`](https://danigiro.github.io/FoReco/reference/cssmp.html) | [`tesmp()`](https://danigiro.github.io/FoReco/reference/tesmp.html) | [`ctsmp()`](https://danigiro.github.io/FoReco/reference/ctsmp.html) |


Additionally, `FoReco` provides various functions for different aspects of forecast reconciliation, including aggregating time series, balancing hierarchies, computing projection and covariance matrices, and more.
