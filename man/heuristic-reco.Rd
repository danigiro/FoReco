\usage{
# First-temporal-then-cross-sectional forecast reconciliation
tcsrec(base, cslist, telist, res = NULL, avg = "KA")

# First-cross-sectional-then-temporal forecast reconciliation
cstrec(base, cslist, telist, res = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{base}{A (\eqn{n \times h(k^\ast+m)}) numeric matrix containing the base
forecasts to be reconciled; \eqn{n} is the total number of variables,
\eqn{m} is the maximum aggregation order, and \eqn{k^\ast} is the sum of a
chosen subset of the \eqn{p - 1} factors of \eqn{m} (excluding \eqn{m}
itself), and \eqn{h} is the forecast horizon for the lowest frequency time
series. The row identifies a time series, and the forecasts in each row are
ordered from the lowest frequency (most temporally aggregated) to the
highest frequency.}

\item{cslist}{A list of elements for the cross-sectional reconciliation.
See \link{csrec} for a complete list (excluded \code{base} and \code{res}).}

\item{telist}{A list of elements for the temporal reconciliation.
See \link{terec} for a complete list (excluded \code{base} and \code{res}).}

\item{res}{A (\eqn{n \times N(k^\ast+m)}) optional numeric matrix containing
the in-sample residuals ordered from the lowest frequency to the highest
frequency (columns) for each variable (rows). This matrix is used to
compute some covariance matrices.}

\item{avg}{If \code{avg = "KA"} (\emph{default}), the final projection
matrix \eqn{\mathbf{M}} is the one proposed by Kourentzes and
Athanasopoulos (2019), otherwise it is calculated as simple average of
all the involved projection matrices at step 2 of the procedure (see
Di Fonzo and Girolimetto, 2023).}
}
\value{
A (\eqn{n \times h(k^\ast+m)}) numeric matrix of cross-temporal
reconciled forecasts.
}
\description{
\link{tcsrec} replicates the procedure by Kourentzes and Athanasopoulos (2019):
(i) for each time series the forecasts at any temporal aggregation order are
reconciled using temporal hierarchies; (ii) time-by-time cross-sectional
reconciliation is performed; and (iii) the projection matrices obtained at
step (ii) are then averaged and used to cross-sectionally reconcile the
forecasts obtained at step (i). In \link{cstrec}, the order of application of the
two reconciliation steps (temporal first, then cross-sectional), is inverted
compared to \link{tcsrec} (Di Fonzo and Girolimetto, 2023).
}
\section{Warning}{

The two-step heuristic reconciliation allows considering
non negativity constraints only in the first step. This means that non-negativity
is not guaranteed in the final reconciled values.
